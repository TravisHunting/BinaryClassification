# BinaryClassification

Binary image classification using a dense neural network with tensorflow and Google colab. 

This is by no means an optimized network, rather it is intended as a tutorial on how to create one using tensorflow. 

Identification of front-facing human faces using cv2. 

It should be relatively easy to extend this to any number of classifications rather than 2.
